Load balancing:	
distribute the traffic from user to backend servers

Health Check
Periodic test performed by load balancer to check availability and performance of backend servers.

Session persistence:
Technique that ensures the subsequent requests from same client are sent to the same backend server and maintains the session state, providing consistent user experience.

Load balancer can perform decrypting of SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic at the load balancer lavel, and offloads burden from backend servers and allows centralized SSL/TLS management.

SSL- secure sockey layer
TLS- Transport level security

How SSL/TLS works?
-> handshake process
-> certificate validation
-> key exchange
-> symmetric encryption
-> Data integrity
